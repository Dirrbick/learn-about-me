        Biography of Kory Jackson
      </h2>
        <div class="shortStory">
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Kory Jackson. Yes, it is spelled with a "K". Most people call me Cody but, you can call me Kory. I started working at McDonald's at the age of 14, I then stayed there for 6 years and learned a lot of work ethics. As I grew up I had always imagined myself being a landscape architect or serving in the Air Force. I ended up going into the military back in January 2012. I was only in for 2.5 years due to life experiences, of which made me the man I am today. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After the military I had 2 choices, move back to my hometown in Minnesota or move out to Washington to start a new life. I decided on the latter choice. When I moved out to Washington, the plan was to work towards my other childhood imagination... that didn't work out too well. I didn't even get started down that path before I realized my passion was for cooking. At that moment I signed up for culinary school and I got an Associates in Culinary Arts. With that I have been a professional Chef for the last 3 years. I learned quickly that it is too hard of a career for both the body and family. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal over the coarse of the next 12 months is to learn a whole new career. I have always enjoyed working with computers but I have no idea about the software or how it runs, yet. My goal is to become a software engineer and excel at what ever lays ahead of me.
